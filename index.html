      <p>Here's the projects:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<a href="http://textgenerator.ninglyu.me/">text generator</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://polynomial.ninglyu.me/">polynomial</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://minesweeper.ninglyu.me/">Minesweeper</a>.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://geemail.ninglyu.me/">Gee-mail</a>. </li>
</ol>

<p>It is really hard to say that I'm good at this, since the projects we finished are not so good and they are lack of many features that should have been done. And as a new learner about this, the class is tough for me to keep up with. Even this, I still learned a lot of C &amp; C++ programing skills. And it has brought me to a brand new field. I'll keep on learning, try to figure it out about the whole things. Finally, I want to thank my professor, Prof.Ninja. He is so devoted and caring about students. If I have chance(and may be with the skills to keep up with), I wish I could join his class again. Thank you again, professor. </p>
